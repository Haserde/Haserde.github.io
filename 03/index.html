    <p>Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silverstein</p>
       <br> There is a place where the sidewalk ends
       <br> And before the street begins,
       <br>  And there the grass grows soft and white,
       <br>  And there the sun burns crimson bright,
       <br>  And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
       <br>  To cool in the peppermint wind.

       <br>  Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
       <br>  And the dark street winds and bends.
       <br>  Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
       <br>  We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
       <br>  And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
       <br> To the place where the sidewalk ends.

       <br>  Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
       <br>  And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
       <br>  For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
       <br>  The place where the sidewalk ends.
