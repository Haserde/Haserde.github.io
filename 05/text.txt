Reader's Digest magazine has a readability index of about 65, Time magazine scores about 52, an average grade six student's written assignment (age of 12) has a readability index of 60–70 (and a reading grade level of six to seven), and the Harvard Law Review has a general readability score in the low 30s. The highest (easiest) readability score possible is around 120 (e.g. every sentence consisting of only two one-syllable words; "The cat sat on the mat." scores 116). The score does not have a theoretical lower bound. It is possible to make the score as low as wanted by arbitrarily including words with many syllables. The sentence "This sentence, taken as a reading passage unto itself, is being used to prove a point." has a readability of 74.1. The sentence "The Australian platypus is seemingly a hybrid of a mammal and reptilian creature." scores 24.4 as it has 26 syllables and 13 words. While Amazon calculates the text of Moby Dick as 57.9,[9] one particularly long sentence about sharks in chapter 64 has a readability score of −146.77.[10] One sentence in the beginning of "Swann's Way", by Marcel Proust, has a score of −515.1.[11] Even further, the chemical name for titin, 189,819 characters long, scores a −6,128,472, with 72,443 syllables.

The U.S. Department of Defense uses the reading ease test as the standard test of readability for its documents and forms.[12] Florida requires that life insurance policies have a Flesch reading ease score of 45 or greater.[13]

Use of this scale is so ubiquitous that it is bundled with popular word processing programs and services such as KWord, IBM Lotus Symphony, Microsoft Office Word, WordPerfect, and WordPro.

Polysyllabic words affect this score significantly more than they do the grade level score.
